# Museifu Basic Theme
A simpler version of [Museifu Theme](https://github.com/account-not-relevant/museifu-theme), with less modularity and a more fix appearance.

## Features

### Accent color centered.
Also includes an accented callout (`> [!accented]`) that follows the accent color.

### "Pen color" modifications
The modular aspect from Museifu means you should be able to customize notes individually. To achieve that, you can use pen colors! _A tutorial explaining the colors and how to use will be added later._
